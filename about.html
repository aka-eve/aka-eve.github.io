            <h4>More About Me.</h4>
            <p>I'm sangyeop. I obtained B.S.(2021) degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ajou university. Currently, I'm a M.S. & Ph.D. student at Laboratory of Advanced Imaging Technology (LAIT) in the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), under the supervision of Prof.Jaejun Yoo. </p>
            <p>My main research area lies at the intersection of generative models, optimization, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in personalized generative models. My research focuses on computationally efficient and data-efficient generative models to address the cost issues that pose significant barriers for individuals. Additionally, I have a strong interest in image generation and editing using generative models such as diffusion models and GANs, as well as in methods for evaluating these models.</p>
